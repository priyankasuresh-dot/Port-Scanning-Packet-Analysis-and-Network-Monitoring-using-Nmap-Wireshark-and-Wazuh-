# Port-Scanning-Packet-Analysis-and-Network-Monitoring-using-Nmap-Wireshark-and-Wazuh-
This project demonstrates network reconnaissance, scanning, and monitoring using Nmap, Wireshark, and Wazuh in a controlled cybersecurity lab. The goal is to understand how different types of port scans work, how they appear at the packet level, and how security monitoring tools detect suspicious activities.
